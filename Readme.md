## HTML
"First, we have our HTML file. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it's used to structure our web page."
"At the top, we have the <head> section, which contains meta information about our page, like the character set and the title."
"In the <body> section, we have a <div> with an ID of 'message' that displays our greeting message. We also have an input box and two buttons."

## CSS
"Next, we have some CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is used to style our web page."
"Here, we're setting the font, centering the text, and adding some padding and margins to our elements."

## JS
"Finally, we have our JavaScript. JavaScript is a programming language that allows us to add interactivity to our web page."
"We have a function called changeMessage that gets the value from the input box and updates the text inside the 'message' <div>."
"We also have a function called changeBackgroundColor that changes the background color of the page to a random color from a predefined list."
